In chemistry, an element is a pure substance which cannot be broken down by chemical means, consisting of atoms which have identical numbers of protons in their atomic nuclei.
</p>
<br>
<p class="element">
When different elements are combined, they may produce a chemical reaction and form into compounds due to chemical bonds holding the constituent atoms together.
</p>
<br>
<p class="element">
The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that discovered native minerals like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold (though the concept of a chemical element was not yet understood).
</p>
<br>
<p class="element">
Much of the modern understanding of elements is attributed to Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist who published the first recognizable periodic table in 1869. The properties of the chemical elements are summarized in this table
</p>
<br>
<p class="element">
which organizes them by increasing atomic number into rows ("periods") in which the columns ("groups") share recurring ("periodic") physical and chemical properties. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="element">
Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through 82 each have at least one stable isotope (except for technetium, element 43 and promethium, element 61, which have no stable isotopes).
